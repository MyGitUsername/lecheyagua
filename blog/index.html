<h3> Setting up Leche y Agua </h3>
<p> This website is hosted with Netlify and uses a custom domain name.  To make the website
available we changed the domain name servers on the website of our
domain provider to Netlify's custom hostnames assigned to our DNS zone.  Also, be sure to enable IPV6.  Yes, it is really that easy!
</p>
<p>
Deploying new changes to the website is also convenient with Netlify.  We simply push our changes to github, and Netlify manages the rest.

I'm glad that I realized I can host my website for free with a static webpage hosting service rather than paying for an expensive hosting plan with services that I don't need - this isn't a web app... it's just plain 'ol HTML.

Thanks Netlify!
